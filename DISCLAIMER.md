# Disclaimer

## 1. Personal Self-Experimentation

The data, logs, routines, and protocols contained in **Project Limitless** are the result of a single-subject (n = 1) longitudinal
self-experiment conducted by **Atharv Dewangan** (the "Author"). This repository documents personal experience and observations and
is not a clinical study or institutional research project.

## 2. Research Status and Scope

This project is exploratory and observational in nature. It is **not peer-reviewed** and does not claim scientific validation,
generalizability, or universal applicability. All conclusions are context-specific and may change over time as the experiment evolves.

## 3. Data Integrity and Limitations

While the Author strives for accuracy in data collection, this information is recorded in a non-controlled, real-world environment.
The "Perfect Day" protocols are iterations in progress and should be viewed as experimental hypotheses rather than proven results.

## 4. No Medical or Professional Advice

The contents of this repository are provided for documentation and informational purposes only. Nothing herein constitutes medical,
psychological, educational, or professional advice. The protocols described (including reduced sleep and high-intensity cognitive load)
carry inherent health risks. This material is not a substitute for professional medical consultation or individualized healthcare guidance.

## 5. Assumption of Risk

Any individual who chooses to reference, replicate, adapt, or experiment with ideas or data presented in this repository does so voluntarily
and at their own risk. Atharv Dewangan assumes no responsibility for any direct or indirect adverse outcomes. This includes, but is not
limited to: acute or chronic health complications, burnout, cognitive impairment, psychological distress, or the exacerbation of
pre-existing conditions.

## 6. Ethical Stop-Loss and Safety Priority

As part of responsible self-experimentation, the Author reserves the right to modify, pause, or terminate the experiment at any time if
safety or well-being thresholds are reached. These may include sustained physical symptoms, severe cognitive decline, or psychological
distress.

## 7. Use and Interpretation

This repository is intended as an open notebook for reflection, self-analysis, and iterative learning. It should not be interpreted as a
prescriptive system or a recommendation for others to follow without independent judgment and appropriate safeguards.
