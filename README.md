## Overview

Project Limitless is a longitudinal self-experiment aimed at designing and
refining a sustainable high-intensity study day by tracking sleep, focus,
and productivity. This research focuses on the intersection of sleep optimization and cognitive endurance.

## Method

- Daily qualitative logs (sleep, focus, energy, reflections)
- Quantitative tracking (study hours, sleep duration, focus estimates)
- Iterative routine experiments
- Periodic analysis and refinement

The goal is to move toward a hypothesized "Steady-State Perfect Day" consisting of:

- **Productive Output:** 16–18 Hours
- **Restorative Sleep:** 4–6 Hours
- **Maintenance:** 1–2 Hours (Nutrition, Hygiene, Bio-breaks)
